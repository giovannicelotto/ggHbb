# Two purposes:
1) Define all the processes for MC (with their cross sections and path Nano -> Flat) and Data (with luminosity and path Nano -> Flat)
'''python processes.py'''
2) Compute the sumw events generated for each of the MC processes. This is done in parallel by submitting a job in slurm
'''bash runComputMini.sh'''
